Data engineering project for UCL course Data Engineering.

The outcome of the project is a website hosted on AWS lambda that gets a company's trading name as an input, calls the APIs of Yahoo Finance and Twitter, returns information about the stock and performs sentiment analysis on the latest tweets about it.

Throughout the project, a database on AWS RDS was created and was populated with sample data from Parquet files using Apache Spark.
